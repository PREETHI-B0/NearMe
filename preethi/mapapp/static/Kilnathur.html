<p align ="center">Kilnathur is a village located in the Thiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu, India. Thiruvannamalai is known for its famous Arunachaleswarar Temple, one of the largest temple complexes in India dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Kilnathur, like many villages in the district, likely has its own local economy and culture, but I don't have specific information about it. If you're looking for details about Kilnathur, you might want to explore local resources or news outlets for more information.</p>
