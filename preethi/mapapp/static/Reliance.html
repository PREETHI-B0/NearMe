<p align="center">Reliance Industries, led by Mukesh Ambani, is one of India's largest conglomerates with interests in various sectors including petrochemicals, refining, oil & gas exploration, telecommunications, and retail. As of my last update, I don't have specific information about Reliance's presence in Thiruvannamalai, but it's possible they have operations or investments in the region given their extensive nationwide presence.</p>
